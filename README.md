# AI-enabled Skin Cancer Diagnosis Assistant

This project focuses on building an **AI-based web application** that uses **deep learning** to classify various types of skin cancer lesions. It addresses the need for accurate, real-time, and early diagnosis of skin cancer, particularly focusing on the differentiation between melanoma and non-melanoma skin lesions. The backbone of this system is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, trained to classify pigmented skin lesions into seven categories based on dermoscopic images. 

## Introduction

Skin cancer is among the most common types of cancer worldwide, with increasing numbers diagnosed every year. **Early diagnosis** can drastically improve survival rates. Traditionally, dermatologists rely on **dermoscopy** for diagnosis, which is time-consuming and heavily dependent on the expertise of the practitioner. This project uses **deep learning techniques** to assist medical professionals by providing automated classification of skin lesions, thereby offering a **quick and reliable second opinion**.

## Why Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)?

The project places a heavy emphasis on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** over **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** due to the nature of the taskâ€”image classification. Traditional machine learning and ANN approaches depend heavily on **manual feature extraction** from images, which can be error-prone and time-consuming. CNNs are particularly suitable for this task because:
1. **Automatic Feature Extraction**: CNNs learn to extract hierarchical features directly from raw images without human intervention.
2. **Spatial Hierarchy**: The convolution operation allows CNNs to capture local patterns (like edges, textures) which are crucial for image analysis, while deeper layers capture more complex structures.
3. **Efficiency**: CNNs reduce the dimensionality of input images while maintaining relevant information through techniques like pooling, making them computationally efficient.

Compared to **ANNs**, which struggle with large image inputs, CNNs are much more suited to the high-dimensional nature of image data. This makes CNNs the preferred choice for skin cancer diagnosis, where subtle visual cues differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous lesions.

## Experiments and Results

### Comparison between CNN and ANN models:
| Model               | Feature Extraction | Image Input Size | Complexity | Accuracy | AUC-ROC |
|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------|----------|---------|
| **ANN**             | Manual             | Low              | Medium     | 70.23%   | 0.82    |
